              Holy s*** these dragons can be so annoying and they barely ever
              land because theyre god damn cowards. I went to Dawnstar while
              farming and selling and the idiot blacksmith ran out and got
              killed, so here I am just a bit overencumbered waiting for the
              miniscule fart sack guards to do something to no avail. I decide
              im just gonna go out and kill it and theres the blacksmiths
              daughter dead on the road now with 3 other NPCs. I put the dragon
              down but now half this town is dead? they dont respawn? there is
              only so many blacksmiths and if these people dont come back and
              ruin it for people after how many hours they put in I think thats
              absolute dog s***. I was already mad that I got the bug twice
              where the whole town just super aggressively tries to start
              killing you and now this. Is there no way to correct these
              problems if your game is on a switch or another console?
